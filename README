WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?
------------------------------
Qt switcher is intended to be used by all those having installed multiple Qt versions from my pkgbuilds.
Those packagebuilds can be found either in my repository or (soon) in the AUR (Arch User Repository)

Sooner or later qt-switcher will provide a bridge to make it possible to install a not installed qt version
via talking to yaourt and list only those qt versions which are installed on your system.

HOWTO USE?
------------------------------

Start qt-switcher using

(IMPLEMENTED) source qt-switcher
source qt-switcher "qt-version-name"
source qt-switcher --help
